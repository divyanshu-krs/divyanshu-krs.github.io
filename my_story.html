											<h2>My Story!<br/>
											</h2>
										</header>
										<p> I am super fan of listening and reading about someone's joruney and after I got invovled in research, I have come across so many individuals who have been doing tremendous work. I always wanted to know more about them like where and how did they grow up? How was the school or college? How did they become what they are now? Did they ever fail in a course? (:p) Some hobbies? and etc. </p>
										
										<p>Therefore I decided to tell my story, here on this page.</p>
										
										<h3>Places where I have lived</h3>
										<p>I was born in New Delhi, India. I was brought up at different places in Haryana and Rajasthan such as - Jaisalmer, Sonipat, Rohtak, Jhajjar and etc. I do not have enough memories of Sonipat and Jaisalmer, but I can never forget my stay at Jhajjar - I lived there for 7 years. Finally, we moved back to Delhi in 2010 but the place where I lived was on the outskirts of Delhi - so yeah, pretty much felt like Haryana only. From 2015 onwards till 2017, I lived in a paying guest service in New Delhi, for my schooling and coahing for IIT Jee. Thought In 2016, my family moved to Rohtak - this was one of the best places, not only because there was a lot of too and fro visit between Rohtak and Delhi, but those long drive were super amazing. Crossing fields, highways, sunset, sunrise, etc it was superb, plus the village where I lived in Rohtak was really beautiful, the air, the aura - everything was just perfect. In 2017, I moved to hostel at IIIT Delhi - which is real love. :) (By the way, if you are wondering why did I had to move to some many places - it is because my Dad used to get transferred every 4-5 years.)</p>

										<h3>Education</h3>
										<p>I was really not a studios child and teachers used to scold me a lot. When I was kindergarten, I was really bad at Hindi - the grammar gave me a hard time. I scored poorly in Hindi and my mother decided to again send me to kindergarten and all my friends went to next class. It was in third standard when I joined D.H Lawerence Senior Secondary School in Jhajjar, and after first unit test I asked my teacher who got first position and she said it was me. My god, that day I went to home I told my parents I came first, they did not believed me and called my teacher to confirm this. Then till, fifth standard I came first in every exam. From sixth standard onwards, I joined D.P.S Bahadurgarh - this place had a special corner in my heart. I had really good time here, not only academically I was doing quite brilliant but I engaged in lot other things. For example, I became part of school's basketball team and went onto play four tournament and won second position in Jhajjar district. I was super active in Science fairs, twice I participated in Annual Inter DPS Science Fair and both the time bagged top position. Apart from it, I did participated in Dance and Art. I made some really amazing friends there, some of whom are still with me.</p>
										

										<p>Then after 10th class, I joined a S.M Arya Public School complete my 12th standard from Delhi and enroll for IIT-JEE Coaching. Though the coaching was more fun than S.M Arya, but some of the teachers there were really supportive and caring.
										</p>
										<p>
										Then comes IIIT Delhi, I am currently here and so far my time has been quite a journey which is full of ups and downs, laughters and tears - it is bag full of achievements and failures. IIIT Delhi is definitely a place where the community connect is strong, I am super lucky that I am in this college along with my childhood friend. I do not want to imagine my life here without him. Everday is kind of a challege here, I had fine academic score in the beginning then I made a huge downfall in the middle, also failed a course. But, then I got involved in research with Dr. Jainendra Shukla - he has been my mentor since then. I have slowly started to perfom back in academic, did a couple of user studies.
