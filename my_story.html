											<h2>My Story!<br/>
											</h2>
										</header>
										<p> I am super fan of listening and reading about someone's joruney and after I got invovled in research, I have come across so many individuals who have been doing tremendous work. I always wanted to know more about them, their journey from undergrad years, etc. </p>
										
										<p>Therefore, I just decided to tell my story, here on this page.</p>
										
										<h3>Places where I have lived</h3>
										<p>I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi">New Delhi</a>, India and I was brought at different rural places in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana">Haryana</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan">Rajasthan</a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaisalmer">Jaisalmer</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonipat">Sonipat</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohtak">Rohtak</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jhajjar">Jhajjar</a>. I do not have enough memories of Sonipat and Jaisalmer, but I can never forget my stay at Jhajjar - I lived there for 7 years before moving back to Delhi in 2010. I stayed in paying </p>

										<h3>Education</h3>
										<p>I was really not a studios child and teachers used to scold me a lot. When I was kindergarten, I was really bad at Hindi - the grammar gave me a hard time. I scored poorly in Hindi and my mother decided to again send me to kindergarten and all my friends went to next class. It was in third standard when I joined <a href ="http://www.dhlschool.in/">D.H Lawerence Senior Secondary School</a> in Jhajjar, and after first unit-test I asked my teacher who got first position and she said it was me. My god, that day I went to home I told my parents I came first, they did not believed me and called my teacher to confirm this. From sixth standard onwards, I joined <a href="https://dpsbahadurgarh.com/index.php">D.P.S Bahadurgarh</a> - this place had a special corner in my heart. I had good time here, not only academically but I engaged in lot other things. For example, I became part of school's basketball team and went onto play four tournaments and won second position in Jhajjar district. I was super active in Science fairs, I participated twice in Annual Inter DPS Science Fair and both the time bagged top position. If I ever were to describe you what that school means to me <span>&#8212;</span> It was like a river (<a href="http://www.english-for-students.com/The-Brook.html">'The Brook'</a>.)</p>
										

										<p>Then after 10th class, I joined a S.M Arya Public School to complete my 12th standard from Delhi and enrolled for IIT-JEE Coaching. Though the coaching was more fun than S.M Arya, but some of the teachers there were really supportive and caring. S.M Arya is no ordinary school it is not perfect at all, which actually made it special and fun. It was simply fun that is all I could tell you.
										</p>
										<p>
										Then comes IIIT Delhi, I am currently here and so far my time has been quite a journey which is full of ups and downs, laughters and tears <span>&#8212;</span> it is bag full of achievements and failures. IIIT Delhi is definitely a place where the community connect is strong, I am super lucky that I am in this college along with my childhood friend. Everday is kind of a challege here, I had fine academic score in the beginning then I made a huge downfall in the middle, also failed a course. But, then I got involved in research with Dr. Jainendra Shukla - he has been my mentor/advisor since then. Since then I slowly started bringing myself up in academics.
