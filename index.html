      Hi there!
    </p>
    <p>I'm currently a Ph.D. student in <a href="https://infosci.cornell.edu/">Information Science at Cornell
        University</a>, based
      in NYC at Cornell Tech. I'm advised primarily by <a href="https://www.nixdell.com/">Nicola Dell</a> and <a
        href="https://destrin.tech.cornell.edu/">Deborah Estrin</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I design and build sociotechnical systems that help us care for each other. Lately I've been working on
      large-scale
      computational analysis of the language of online therapy; justice-oriented design of caregiving systems in home
      health; and computer security for victims and survivors of intimate partner violence. More fundamentally, I'm
      interested in mitigating the harms caused by technocratic largesse through feminist approaches to the design and
      development of computing systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      I earned a B.A. from Princeton University in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, focusing on epidemiological
      modeling for global health. I also earned an M.S. from Cornell Tech in Health Tech. In previous lives I made
      radio,
      print
      and multimedia journalism and ran early-stage product
      development at a consumer health tech startup. I've also worked as a healthcare consultant in the U.S. and taught
      software
      engineering.
