      Hi! I am Divyanshu &#x1F44B;.

    <p>I'm a PhD Student at Department of Information Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I am adivsed by <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/semaan/" target="_blank">Bryan Semaan</a>. 
      My work lies at the intersection of Critical HCI and Social Justice.

    <p>
      I use ethnographic and computational methods in my work. My current research is exploring the experiences of historically disadvantaged communties (e.g., caste) within online communities. 
      I have been part of multiple interdiscplinary research work, such as a.) understanding challenges of using education technology in conflict affected communities and b.) exploring ethical consideration arising from deployment of social robots in classroom context.
    </p>
    <p>Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Software Engineer at Scry Analytics for a year. I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from IIIT Delhi, India in 2021. I worked as a student reseracher in <a href="https://hmi.iiitd.edu.in/index.html" target="_blank">Human-Machine Interaction Lab</a>
