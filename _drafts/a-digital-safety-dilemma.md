When NYC went under COVID-19 lockdown orders in the spring of 2020, social services throughout the city were forced to close their doors.

At the <a href="https://www.ceta.tech.cornell.edu/">Clinic to End Tech Abuse</a>, we had been running for several years an in-person clinic to support victims of IPV with specialized digital privacy and security assistance. The clinic grew out of research conducted at the <a href="https://www.ipvtechresearch.org/">IPV Tech Research Group</a> here at Cornell. Our protocols are described in <a href="https://www.nixdell.com/papers/2019-usenix_clinical_security_FULL.pdf">this paper</a>, and our experiences with clients (pre-pandemic) are described in <a href="https://emtseng.me/assets/Freed-2019-CSCW_Is-my-phone-hacked.pdf">this one</a>.

On a personal note: Naming and understanding the events of 2020 will occupy us all for quite some time. This paper is my effort at contributing just one piece of knowledge towards our collective memory of the hell of a year it has been---with the hope that we can learn from it and from each other to build better worlds for us all.
